### Audience

This presentation is designed for Netflix executives and content strategy teams. The audience is familiar with the data but requires actionable insights to guide content production and marketing decisions. The focus is on helping them analyze global trends in Netflix content performance across different categories and regions to optimize future content investments.

### Purpose

The objective is to analyze Netflix's top-performing content based on weekly viewership, regional trends, runtime analysis, and cumulative weeks in the top 10. By comparing English and non-English films and TV shows, the presentation provides strategic recommendations for increasing investment in non-English content and adjusting marketing strategies to align with regional preferences.

### Medium

A PowerPoint presentation was chosen for delivering insights in a structured and visually engaging manner. This format allows for a clear presentation of key trends and data points, ensuring that executives can quickly grasp insights and make informed decisions. The presentation contains six visuals that highlight critical findings derived from the three datasets used.

### Design Strategy

1. **Color**: Netflix’s brand colors—red, black, and white—were used to maintain consistency. Different shades distinguish categories such as English vs. Non-English and Films vs. TV to enhance readability and prevent visual overload.
2. **Text**: Key insights and metrics are emphasized using large font sizes for titles and statistics. Axis labels and legends are kept smaller to maintain focus on critical takeaways without unnecessary distractions.
3. **Alignment**: Charts, labels, and text elements are consistently aligned for a clean and structured layout. Visual hierarchy is maintained, with explanations placed below charts to aid understanding without cluttering the slides.
4. **Sizing**: The slides are designed to be legible from a distance, ensuring clarity during executive presentations. Charts occupy a significant portion of each slide, leaving space for annotations and key takeaways.
5. **Spacing**: Sufficient white space surrounds each visualization to prevent clutter. This ensures that information is digestible and the audience can follow the logical flow of insights.

### Ethical Considerations

1. **Data Modifications**: The data was cleaned and transformed by handling missing values, correcting formats, and aggregating information where necessary. Outliers were retained to maintain an accurate representation of content performance.
2. **Legal and Regulatory Compliance**: The dataset relates to Netflix viewership and content performance. While no personally identifiable information (PII) is included, all data handling aligns with Netflix’s privacy and data-sharing policies.
3. **Risks in Data Transformation & Visualization**: Aggregated trends could lead to misinterpretation of content performance. Efforts were made to minimize bias by clearly labeling data exclusions and maintaining transparency in transformations.
4. **Data Assumptions & Filtering**: Assumptions made regarding missing data were documented. Any filtered data was labeled, ensuring that exclusions were justified and did not impact critical insights.
5. **Data Source & Credibility**: The datasets were assumed to originate from reliable sources such as Netflix’s internal reports or verified third-party datasets (e.g., Kaggle). The credibility of trends was validated by cross-referencing with publicly available reports.
6. **Ethical Data Acquisition**: The data used adheres to ethical sourcing standards and does not violate privacy guidelines. No personally identifiable information was included in the dataset.
7. **Mitigation Strategies for Ethical Concerns**:
   - **Transparency**: All data processing steps, including assumptions and transformations, are documented.
   - **Clarity in Visualization**: Misleading representations were avoided by ensuring that filtered data was clearly identified.
   - **Privacy Protections**: The dataset does not include PII, mitigating privacy concerns.
   - **Accuracy Verification**: Findings were cross-referenced with external sources to prevent misrepresentation.

### Conclusion

This presentation provides Netflix executives with data-driven insights to optimize content investment strategies.
