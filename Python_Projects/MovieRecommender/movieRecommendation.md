# Movie Recommendation System

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques. The dataset used for this project is the MovieLens dataset, which contains millions of movie ratings from users. The goal is to provide personalized movie recommendations to users based on their past ratings and preferences.

## Objectives

- Develop a recommendation system using collaborative filtering.
- Compare the performance of user-based and item-based collaborative filtering.
- Evaluate the impact of different similarity measures on recommendation quality.
- Visualize key insights and findings through relevant plots and metrics.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing

- Load and clean the dataset.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution and patterns.
- Handle missing values and outliers.
- Prepare the data for collaborative filtering.

### Milestone 2: Model Development

- Implement user-based collaborative filtering.
- Implement item-based collaborative filtering.
- Evaluate models using metrics such as RMSE and MAE.

### Milestone 3: Results and Visualization

- Compare model performance based on RMSE and MAE.
- Generate precision-recall curves.
- Identify the most influential users and items.
- Visualize results using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

### Milestone 4: Presentation and Reporting

- Create a comprehensive report summarizing findings and insights.
- Develop visualizations and charts to support the analysis.
- Present the final model and recommendations.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thenein/movie-recommendation-system.git
   ```
2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn surprise jupyter
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook MovieRecommendation.ipynb
   ```
4. Run all cells in the notebook to preprocess data, train models, and visualize results.

## Results

- Model performance metrics will be presented in the final report.
- Key visualizations include precision-recall curves and influential user/item plots.

## Future Work

- Incorporate additional features for improved recommendation accuracy.
- Explore deep learning models for recommendations.
- Deploy the best-performing model as a web application for real-time recommendations.
