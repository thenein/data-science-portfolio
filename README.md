## Python Projects

- [Project 1: Movie Recommendation System](./projects/movie-recommendation-system.md): A system that recommends movies to users based on their viewing history and preferences using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques.
- [Project 2: Hospital Readmission Prediction](./projects/hospital-readmission-prediction.md): A model that predicts the likelihood of a patient being readmitted to the hospital within a certain period, using machine learning techniques to analyze patient data and identify key risk factors.
- [Project 3: Big Data: Alive or Dead](./projects/big-data-alive-or-dead.md): An article that explores the current state of big data, discussing its evolution, current applications, and future trends. It examines whether big data is still a relevant and valuable asset in today's data-driven world.
- [Project 4: Real Estate Predictive Model](./projects/real-estate-predictive-model.md): A model that predicts real estate prices based on various factors such as location, size, and market trends. It uses machine learning algorithms to analyze historical data and provide accurate price predictions for properties.
- [Project 5: Titanic EDA](./projects/titanic-eda.md): An exploratory data analysis (EDA) project on the Titanic dataset. This project involves cleaning the data, analyzing various features, and visualizing key insights to understand the factors that influenced the survival of passengers.
